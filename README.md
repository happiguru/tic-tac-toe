# Tic Tac Toe Project

In this project, it is assigned for us to create a Tic Tac Toe game using only Ruby to increase our knowledge on the OOP concepts. 
This project was split in 4 milestones, which were:
- Setting up the project
- Designing the user interface
- Creating the game logic
- Writing the game instructions

The main goal of this project is to asure I master the methods ruby provides and to learn how to replicate them using basic coding knowledge.

## Live Demo
[Live Demo Link](https://repl.it/@pastorp3/tic-tac-toe#README.md)

- A 3x3 grid is displayed on the terminal and the first player chooses a number to place his symbol on that number's position
- The players take turns in order to try to make an uninterrupted row, column or diagonal.
